## Style Guidelines:

- The app will use a dark color scheme to match the user's request. This evokes sophistication and modernity, in combination with a feeling of being in control.
- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FF8C00) for vibrancy and clear call-to-actions in a dark UI. In HSL, this color has a hue of 36 degrees.
- Background color: Dark desaturated orange (#261700). In HSL, the saturation is 30% and the lightness is appropriate to the dark scheme.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFD700) used sparingly for highlighting key data points. The hue is about 30 degrees to the 'left' of orange.
- Clean, sans-serif font for readability.
- Use minimalist icons for categories and navigation.
- Dashboard-centric design with charts and key metrics prominently displayed.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for user interactions.
